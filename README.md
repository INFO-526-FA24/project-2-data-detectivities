# Mass Shooting Analysis in the United States

**Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze trends, correlations, and patterns in mass shooting incidents across the U.S. By studying variables like time, location, demographics, motivations, and weapon details, our goal is to uncover actionable insights that can inform public safety measures and policy-making.

## Datasets Used
We use four key datasets to conduct the analysis:

**Incidents Dataset**

Contains details like date, location, casualties, and weapons used in each incident.
**Offenders Dataset**

Includes demographic data, legal outcomes, and other attributes related to the offenders.
**Victims Dataset**

Provides demographic details of victims and their relationships with shooters.
**Weapons Dataset**

Details weapon types, gun classes, and acquisition methods.
All datasets are integrated using a common identifier, incident_id, to ensure consistency across analyses.

**Methodology**
We will use statistical and visual analysis to answer the research questions. Key steps include:

**Data Preprocessing**

Cleaning and organizing datasets, handling missing values, and merging them using incident_id.
**Analysis Techniques**

Time series analysis for temporal trends.
Correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.
Heatmaps and geographic maps to visualize location-based patterns.
**Visualization Tools**

Charts and plots for patterns and trends (e.g., line charts, density plots).
Geographic and heatmaps for spatial analysis.
