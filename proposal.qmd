## ***Main Aim of the Project:***

To analyze and identify trends, correlations, and patterns in mass shooting incidents across the United States based on time, location, demographics, and other relevant factors, providing insights that could aid in public safety measures and policy considerations.

## ***Project Goals:***

This project aims to uncover key trends in mass shooting incidents, including patterns over time, geographic areas most affected, and correlations between shooter characteristics and the severity or frequency of these events. Given the growing number of incidents, gaining a clearer understanding of contributing factors and patterns could be valuable for both researchers and policymakers.

The project will involve an in-depth analysis using multiple datasets, each with detailed information on incidents, including fatalities, injuries, shooter demographics, mental health indicators, weapon acquisition details, and possible motivations. By examining correlations between these variables and incident severity, the goal is to identify potential insights for predictive modeling and public safety recommendations.

## ***Reason of choosing :***

The dataset was chosen because it provides a uniquely detailed view of mass shooting incidents in the U.S., enabling an in-depth analysis of trends over time and geography. It includes comprehensive data on shooter demographics, incident locations, and outcomes (fatalities and injuries), as well as factors like shooter motivation and weapon acquisition. This variety allows for nuanced, multidimensional insights, such as exploring correlations between shooter characteristics and incident severity or identifying high-risk times and locations. Additionally, the dataset’s structure supports advanced visualization methods that can bring clarity to complex patterns, making it ideal for a thorough and visually compelling exploration of mass shooting trends and contributing factors.

## *Dataset*

Incidents Dataset (mass_killing_incidents_public.csv):

***Key Variables:***

-   Date and Location: date, city, state, county, longitude, latitude

-   Casualties: num_victims_killed, num_victims_injured Incident Type: type (e.g., "Family", "Public"), situation_type, location_type (e.g., "Residence/Other shelter")

-   Weapon Details: if_assault_rifle_used (whether an assault rifle was used)

-    Narrative: narrative (provides additional context in free text)

Offenders Dataset (mass_killing_offenders_public.csv):

***Key Variables:***

-   Demographics: age, race, sex

-    Outcomes: suicide (whether the offender committed suicide), deathcause (cause of death), outcome (legal or fatality outcome)

-    Criminal Justice Process: criminal_justice_process, sentence_type, sentence_details

Victims Dataset (mass_killing_victims_public.csv):

***Key Variables:***

-   Victim Demographics: age, race, sex

-   Relationship with Shooter: vorelationship (relationship of the victim to the shooter, e.g., "Family", "Acquaintance", "Other")

Weapons Dataset (mass_killing_weapons_public.csv):

**Key Variables:**

-   Weapon Type: weapon_type (e.g., "gun", "blunt object")

-   Gun Class and Type: gun_class (e.g., "LG" for long gun, "HG" for handgun), gun_type (e.g., "semiautomatic handgun")

## Questions and Analysis plan

The questions we want to answer.

***1.What are the trends in mass shooting incidents over time, and how do they vary geographically across the U.S.? Which states, cities, and incident areas have been most affected?***

***Objective:***

To identify patterns in the frequency, severity, and geographical spread of mass shootings. Analyze incident distribution by state, city, and specific incident locations over time.

***Approach:***

-   Data: mass_killing_incidents_public.csv.

**Variables:**

-   Time-based variables: Year, month, day of week.

-   Geographic variables: State, city, incident area .

-    Outcome variables: Number of fatalities, number of injuries.

***Analytical Steps:***

-   Filtering and grouping data by year to identify annual trends in the number of incidents.

-   Analyze incident frequencies by state and city to find the most affected regions. Identify time patterns.

***Visualizations:***

-   Line Charts: For trend analysis of annual fatalities and injuries.

-    Heatmaps: To show incidents by day of the week or by month, which can highlight high-incident periods.

-   Geographic Maps: Use ggplot2 with sf or maps package to plot incident locations and highlight areas with the highest frequency.

***2.Does the number of votes have a different effect on the IMDb rating on episodes with high or low ratings?***

**Variables:** IMDB_rating, total_votes

**Approach:** Divide episodes to see if it receives above median IMDb rating and below median IMDb rating, followed by investigating whether or not the relationship between votes and ratings differ between these two groups.

**Scatter Plot with Facets:** Split it into two – make a scatter for episodes with more votes highest in the y-axis and a scatter for episodes with lower votes lowest in the y-axis.

**Facet Grid:** One should utilize a facet grid and represent these two groups in one figure.

**Objective:** This will allow us to see whether high vote episodes, positively skewed, make a difference on highly rated episodes compared to lowly rated ones.

***3.Are there any seasons that have more episodes, and does this Sometimes, it is observed that such seasons receive higher ratings on average?***

**Approach for Analysis:**

**Numerical Variables:** episode_num (The number of the episode) IMDB_rating( IMDb rating)

**Categorical Variable:** season_title (Season title)

**Objective:**

Our next question is about the correlation between the total number of episodes per season and the IMDb rating of the respective seasons. More particularly, the following research question has been formulated as follows: Do shows that broadcast more episodes per season compute higher or lower average IMDb ratings per episode?

**Graphs to Use:**

**Bar Plot for Episode Count**: A bar plot of the episodes per season will then give a general feel of which season is more episodes hence is longer.

**Line Plot for Average IMDb Rating:** On top of the bar plot, line plot is intended to represent the mean of the IMDb rating for each season. It will also assist us make a direct comparison on the number of episodes and the average ratings obtained for each series.

***4.Do Certain Seasons Have Higher Variation in IMDb Ratings?***

**Variables:** season_title, IMDB_rating

**Approach:** Compare the fluctuation in IMDb ratings of each season by calculating the standard deviation to find which the seasons have a greater variability or some episodes are considerably better or worse than others.

**Visualization:**

**Bar Plot with Error Bars:** Time series the mean IMDb rating for each of the seasons and standard error of the mean (variability).

**Box Plot:** It also can be applied to show quantitatively the variability of ratings across the seasons of the show.

**Objective:** This can show if potentially some seasons are more homogenised in terms of rating, or if perhaps a couple of particular seasons are either extremely high, or extremely low rated.
