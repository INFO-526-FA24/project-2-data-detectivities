## ***Main Aim of the Project:***

To analyze and identify trends, correlations, and patterns in mass shooting incidents across the United States based on time, location, demographics, and other relevant factors, providing insights that could aid in public safety measures and policy considerations.

## ***Project Goals:***

This project aims to uncover key trends in mass shooting incidents, including patterns over time, geographic areas most affected, and correlations between shooter characteristics and the severity or frequency of these events. Given the growing number of incidents, gaining a clearer understanding of contributing factors and patterns could be valuable for both researchers and policymakers.

The project will involve an in-depth analysis using multiple datasets, each with detailed information on incidents, including fatalities, injuries, shooter demographics, mental health indicators, weapon acquisition details, and possible motivations. By examining correlations between these variables and incident severity, the goal is to identify potential insights for predictive modeling and public safety recommendations.

## ***Reason of choosing :***

The dataset was chosen because it provides a uniquely detailed view of mass shooting incidents in the U.S., enabling an in-depth analysis of trends over time and geography. It includes comprehensive data on shooter demographics, incident locations, and outcomes (fatalities and injuries), as well as factors like shooter motivation and weapon acquisition. This variety allows for nuanced, multidimensional insights, such as exploring correlations between shooter characteristics and incident severity or identifying high-risk times and locations. Additionally, the dataset’s structure supports advanced visualization methods that can bring clarity to complex patterns, making it ideal for a thorough and visually compelling exploration of mass shooting trends and contributing factors.

## Questions and Analysis plan

The questions we want to answer.

***1.What are the trends in mass shooting incidents over time, and how do they vary geographically across the U.S.? Which states, cities, and incident areas have been most affected?***

***Objective:***

To identify patterns in the frequency, severity, and geographical spread of mass shootings. Analyze incident distribution by state, city, and specific incident locations over time.

***Approach:***

-   Data: mass_killing_incidents_public.csv.

**Variables:**

-   Time-based variables: Year, month, day of week.

-   Geographic variables: State, city, incident area .

-   Outcome variables: Number of fatalities, number of injuries.

***Analytical Steps:***

-   Filtering and grouping data by year to identify annual trends in the number of incidents.

-   Analyze incident frequencies by state and city to find the most affected regions. Identify time patterns.

***Visualizations:***

-   Line Charts: For trend analysis of annual fatalities and injuries.

-   Heatmaps: To show incidents by day of the week or by month, which can highlight high-incident periods.

-   Geographic Maps: Use ggplot2 with sf or maps package to plot incident locations and highlight areas with the highest frequency.

***2.Which shooter characteristics—such as demographics, mental health status, age, employment, and weapon acquisition method—correlate with the severity and frequency of mass shootings?***

**Objective:**

To identify whether specific shooter attributes are linked to higher incident severity (e.g., greater fatalities or injuries).

**Approach:**

-   Data: mass_killing_offenders_public.csv and potentially joining with mass_killing_incidents_public.csv based on incident ID.

**Variables:**

-   Demographics: Age, gender, race.

-   Mental Health Status: Indicator of any reported mental health issues.

-   Employment: Employment status at the time of the incident.

-   Weapon Acquisition Method: Legal or illegal acquisition status.

-   Outcome variables: Incident severity, such as total fatalities and injuries.

**Analytical Steps:**

-   Filter and group data based on shooter attributes, analyzing each characteristic individually and in combination.

-   Calculate the average incident severity for each characteristic category.Explore correlation between shooter attributes and severity metrics.

**Visualizations:**

-   Box Plots: To show the distribution of fatalities and injuries across different demographic categories.

-   Correlation Plots: Using the corrplot package to visualize correlations among numerical variables (e.g., age, number of weapons).

-   Density Plots: To show the distribution of fatalities and injuries by weapon acquisition status.

***3.Are there specific temporal patterns in mass shootings (e.g., by day, week, or month) that could provide insights for prediction models or public safety measures?***

**Objective:**

-   To discover any patterns in the timing of incidents that might indicate high-risk periods.

***Approach:***

Data: mass_killing_incidents_public.csv.

**Variables:**

-   Date and Time: Year, month, day of week, and potentially the time of day.

-    Outcome variables: Number of incidents, number of fatalities and injuries.

**Analytical Steps:**

-   Aggregate data by month, day of week, and time to find any consistent patterns in incident timing. Perform time series analysis, if applicable, to identify seasonality or trends.

**Visualizations:**

-   Time Series Line Graphs: Using ggplot2 to visualize monthly incident rates and incident severity over time.

-   Heatmaps: To visualize incidents by weekday and month.

-   Polar Bar Plots: Using the plotly package to plot incidents by time in a circular format to highlight day/night patterns.

***4. How do external factors, such as shooter motivation and state-level variables (e.g., gun ownership rates), affect the nature of mass shootings?

**Objective:**

-   To determine how motivations (e.g., terrorism, hate crimes) or external state-level factors might influence incident characteristics.

***Approach:***

Data: mass_killing_incidents_public.csv and mass_killing_offenders_public.csv. Optionally, integrate external datasets for state-level factors.

**Variables:**

-   Motivations: Shooter’s motivation (e.g., terrorism, hate crime).
-    External Factors: Use additional datasets for state-level variables like gun ownership rates.
-    Outcome variables: Incident characteristics such as severity, location, and frequency.


**Analytical Steps:**

-   Analyze how different motivations correlate with the incident's severity and frequency.For state-level analysis, link incident data with state-level metrics, looking for correlations.

**Visualizations:**

-   Bar Charts: To compare incident severity by motivation category.

-   Choropleth Maps: Map incidents by state, overlaying state gun ownership or other metrics.

-   Bubble Charts: To show incidents based on both motivation and severity, with bubble size reflecting fatalities.

**NOTE: Variable and visualization may change while developing the project.**
